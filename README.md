# üè£Part #1 - Industry Analysis
## Description
As someone who loves coffee and is interested in Toronto's caf√© world, it's important for those wanting to open a caf√© to know what customers like and to ask for their opinions. Doing research is key to making a caf√© stand out and do well in Toronto. NLP (a way to understand text data) is a great tool for looking at what people say because most of the information comes in words.

## Objective
Our team, acting as data consultants, is tasked with aiding a caf√© in selecting the optimal location between Queen St. E. and Bay St., catering to its specialty in coffee and meal offerings for breakfast and lunch. The owner views their diverse menu as a key competitive edge but faces budget constraints affecting decisions on interior decor versus staff hiring to enhance customer experience initially. Beyond location and these decisions, they seek further advice for success.

## Data Collection and Methodology
To analyze the caf√© industry in Toronto, we collected reviews from Google Maps for 12 cafes in Queen St. E. and Bay St. using web scraping. Our "getReviews" function, utilizing Selenium in Python, extracts review details like user name, date, rating, and text by interacting with Google Maps. We stored the data in a Pandas DataFrame, gathering 3262 reviews for market research insights.

## Results
The WordCloud Analysis reveals common words from customer reviews, aiding restaurateurs in pinpointing what matters most to patrons. For location decisions, we analyzed preferences in the Queen St E. and Bay St. areas. Additionally, logistic regression and Naive Bayes models highlighted "amazing," "downtown," "delicious," "awesome," and "friendly" as key positives in reviews, while negatives often mentioned "server," "overpriced," "use," "salad," and "bad." These insights help understand customer feedback and preferences. Below is one example of the WordCloud.

## Business Insights
The analysis reveals that Queen St. E customers prioritize food, evident from its frequent mention in reviews, unlike in Bay St. This suggests Queen St. E as the better location for our client's food-focused caf√©, especially since negative reviews highlight a demand for better food options. Given the emphasis on 'service' in reviews, investing in quality staff over interior design is advisable to stand out, particularly in Queen St. E where service often garners criticism.
Key recommendations include concentrating on breakfast with popular items like cheese, eggs, and salad to attract morning customers. Additionally, addressing complaints about long wait times in Queen St. E could significantly improve customer experience and competitive edge.
